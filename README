copyfiletosharepoint is my attempt to build a python script
that will copy a file from my work Windows laptop up to
my corporate Sharepoint site on Office 365.

It is based on https://github.com/microsoftgraph/python-sample-console-app

python-sample-console-app is a console app that does several things
including uploading a file from my windows laptop to OneDrive.

So I hacked out all of the code except the part that uploaded the file
and I modified it to work with Sharepoint.

As far as licencing goes I'm fine with releasing this under the MIT license
just like Microsoft did. Hopefully I filled out the copyright info correctly.
Some of the code is verbatim MS code from python-sample-console-app. But 
I but a number of hours of work into other code that is all mine. Anyway,
feel free to use this any way you please but there is no warranty. Use
at your own risk. See the file LICENSE.

To get this to work you need to create an application at the site

https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList

The "Application Id" is the same as CLIENT_ID in config.py.

It needs to be a Native application in the Platforms section.

I gave it the following Delegated Permissions, not all of which
are necessarily needed:

Files.ReadWrite.All
People.Read
Sites.ReadWrite.All
User.Read
User.ReadBasic.All
User.ReadWrite

You probably need the following Python packages from pip:

pyperclip
requests
adal

I'm currently using Python 3.6.6 32-bit on Windows 7.

The program has an amusing way of authenticating against Sharepoint.

Here is how you would upload two files in a row, only authenticating once:

session = False

session = upload_one_file(base_path,folder_path,file_name,session)            
session = upload_one_file(base_path,folder_path,file_name2,session)            

The variable session holds the session information after you login the
first time. You want to save it in a variable for subsequent calls
to upload_one_file so you don't have to login each time.

To login it pops up a web browser that asks for a Code on a Device Login page.
In Windows 7 you just right-click and it pastes in your code. Then click Continue.
Then choose your Sharepoint account just as you would logging into Sharepoint on the
web.

After you have done all of these steps the console program starts running. Here
is what the output looks like uploading file_name and file_name2 using the code listed above.

C:\copyfiletosharepoint>python test.py
